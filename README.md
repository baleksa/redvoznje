A simple front-end with html/css and a simple backend in go which scrapes [busevi.com](https://www.busevi.com/) for Belgrade's bus, tram and trolley public transport lines.

[busevi.com](https://www.busevi.com/) loads a bunch of adds, javascript and shows complete line timetable after 2 seconds of loading and executing useless javascript,
so I made a simple alternative.
